'NOTE TO THE REVISED EDITION OF 1889.

,ψ murus

Ι nava found Gradatim to be a most useful book to
accompany and supplement the first year's work in Latin.
The Latin is pure, simple, and idiomatic‚ easily under-
stood by the young leamers, interesting, and even amus-
ing. If Caesar must be read as the first classical author,
this book may be very happily used ior some weeks to
smooth the way, by giving practice in translating easy
Latin. The enormous sale of the book in England shows
how helplul it has proved to teachers in Latin there.
The work of revision has consisted mainly in rewriting
the first twenty anecdotes, —in which the authors made
the unhappy experiment oi writing the Latin in English
order‚-.-marking the quantity of long vowels everywhere,
and correcting the vocabulary, which was unusually rich

in mistakes.
