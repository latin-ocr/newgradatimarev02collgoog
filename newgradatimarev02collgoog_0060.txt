40 THE RELA TI VE.

If there were no relative, we should have to say,

video mr'rrnm et Balbus eum mfirnm aedificivlt I sectile
wall and Balbus built that wall.

Thus it has also the force of a conjunction and serves
to connect sentences,

· RULE 9.-The Relalive agrees with its antecedent

, in gender, number, and person.

r. nos, qui fortiis orimus, pisniblmua we, who are bravi,
will fight.

2. u'a quae parvane puella, nr'rtn'cem amis, you, who are
a little girl, love llic nurse.

Rure ren-The Relalive is not necessarily in the
same case as its antecedent, but in tlte case which
its antecedent would be in if repeated.

1. habea asinum qui (annus) eat laboris patiens you leave
‘an ass wlridr is patient of labor.

2. equus quem (equum) habimus est celer. thelarsa which
we lrave is fast.

3. virum efflue (viri) ffllus es emimus. wc love tlte man
whose son you are.

4. hic est puer oui (puero) poma dedimus, this is tlte boy lo
whom we gave tlte apples.

ς. hasta qui (hasti) hostem occidisti erat ioris tlte spear
with which you killed llic enemy was sharp.

(b) A sentence containing a relative word is often
ealled'an adjectival clause, because it qualifies a
substantive like an adjective.

eat mlhl mensa quae ert nigra, I lave a black table.
