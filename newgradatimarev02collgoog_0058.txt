40 THE RELA TI VE.

n there were no relative, we should have to say,

video murum et Balbus eum mi'uum aedifloivit, I see the
wall and Balbus built that wall.

Thus it has also the force oi a conjunction and serves
to connect sentences.

· Rure 9.-The Relative agrees with its antecedent

. in gender, number, and person.

1. uda qui tortis sumus. pfisnibimus, we, who ure bravi,
will fighi.

2. tr'i, quae parva es puella nutricem amis, you, who are
a little girl, love the nurse.

Rutu 1o.—The Relalive is not necessarily in the
same case as its antecedent, but in the case which
its antecedent would be in if repeated.

1. habr'rs asinum qui (annus) est laboris pauens you have
‘an ass which is patient of labor.

2. equus quem (equum) habemus est celer, ihc horse which
we have is fast.

3. virum ouius (viri) ffllus ee emimus, we love theman
whose rou you are.

4. hio est puer oui (puero) poma dedimus, this is the loy to
whom wc gave the apples.

ς. hasta qui (hasti) hostem occidisti erat fieriu the spear
with which you killed lhc enemy was shurp.

(b) A sentence containing a relative word is often
called an adjectiva] clause, because it qualifies a
substantive like an adjective.

est mihi mensa quae eet nigra, Ι hauc a blach table.
