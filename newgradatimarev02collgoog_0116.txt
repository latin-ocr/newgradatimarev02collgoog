96 CUM CA USAL OR CONCESSIVE.

45. Notice that the subjunctives sis and essdmus
are translated by the indicative. The dependent
clauses are called z'ndz'rect questions, for they repre-

sent quis es? and ubi erimus? ,
46. lndirect questions begin withan interrogative
word and have the verb in the subjunctive.

CUM CAUSAL, OR CONCESSIVE.

47. Cum sometimes means as or since,- some-
times though. When it has either of these two

, meanings it is followed by the subjunctive.

1. Cum amici adsint, gauddmus, since⁸ our friends, are
present, we rejoice.

2. Cum fortiter pugnarent, tamen ndu vicdrunt, though
they fought bravely, y'et they did not conquer.

48. Observe that the subjunctive is translated

as if it were indicative.

THE RELATIVE OF PURPOSE.

49. We may say in Latin : —

1. Ldga'rti missi sunt ut picem peterent
2. Ιιδςξτί missi sunt qui picem peterent.

’ The translation is the same : -
deputies were sent to suasor peace.

50. The relative may be used to denote purpose,
and, with the following subjunctive, may be trans-
lated by the infinitive.
