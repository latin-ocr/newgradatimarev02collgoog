In Latin there is a special form for each person,
both in the singular and the plural, therefore the
pronoun need not be used. „

amo, I [ονε] amis, you love; amat, lte loves.

All nouns are ot the third person; if, therefore, a noun
is used, the verb will be in the third person.

aves cantant, birds sing.

8. Actions differ also in the time ⁴in which they
are done; they may be present, past, or future. In
English, to express this difference, we use other
verbs, called auxiliamur helping verbs, though there
is also a special form for past time.

PRESENT. I love, am leving, or do love.
PAST. I was leving, used to love, did love, lovcal
F UTURE. I shall love.

In Latin there are special tense-forms to express
these differences of time.

PRESENT. ωδ, I love, am leving, or do love.

PAST. amabam, I was leving, used to love, did
love, leveel.

Furuurs. amilio, I shall love.

To give these special tense-forms is called conju·
gating a verb.'

In Latin the present is often used oia past act,
as in English, for the sake of greater vividness.
