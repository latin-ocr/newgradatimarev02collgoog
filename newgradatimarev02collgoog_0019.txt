prepositions, of, to, by, etc.

6. There are thus in Latin five cases in the
singular, each with its own ending, and the same
number in the plural.

To give these changes in the form of a noun is

called declining a noun.

There are also two other cases, the vocative and the
locative. The vocative is used of the person addressed,
but it has always the same form as the nominative, except
in nouns in —us of the second declension. The locutive
is almost confined to names of towns, and expresses the
idea of at, in, on.

’1. Verbs express actions.

Actions are done by different persons: we express
this difference in English by placing pronouns before
the verb, sometimes (but not often) altering its form

also. I love, you love, lae (or she) loves.
