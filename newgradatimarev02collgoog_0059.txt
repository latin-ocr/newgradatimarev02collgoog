ACTIVE AND PASSIVE. 41

A relative clause may be omitted without altering the
construction of any other word in the sentence.

(c) A relative word is often omitted in English
but never in Latin. ἱ

ubi est ea mensa quam heri vidi? where is the table l saw
yesterday?

(d) The relative always comes first in its own
clause (except alter prepositions), and generally
next to the word it qualifies.

Relative words are—

’ ww quine quantus. .
quo, qui, unde. ubl.

ACTIVE AND PASSIVE.

25. The Verb has two voices-

(1) Achae, when you do something;
(2) Passim, when something is done to you.

In turning a sentence frorn an active into a
passive form

accusative becomes nominative.
nominative becomes ablative.

All other cases remain unchanged.
