ORDER.

17. English, having so few case-endings‚ is tied
down to a particular order of words.

The man swallowed the fish
is different from
The fish swallowed the man.

Latin has much more freedom.

homo devoravit piscem,
piscem homo devoravit,
piscem devoravit homo,
devoravit piscem homo,

all mean, “Theman swallowed the fish.'’
