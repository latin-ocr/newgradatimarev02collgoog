13. An adjective is a word added to a noun to
distinguish it from others like it.

In English, adjectives have only one form.

ln Latin, many adjectives have three terminations
· in each case, one for each of the three genders,—
masculine, feminine, and neuter.

Possessive adjectives agree in Latin with the thing j
possessed, and are not affected as in English by the gender ’

of the possessor.

taurus muneravit suam dominam the bull wounded
his mistress.
