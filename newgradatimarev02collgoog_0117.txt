THE ARGONAUTS.

THE ARGONAUTS.

The celebrated voyage oi the Argonauts was brought about

as follows. Pelias had expelled his brother Aeson from his
kingdom in Thessaly and had attempted to take the life oi
Jason, the son ol Aeson. Jason, however, escaped and grew
up to manhood in another country. At last he returned to
Thessaly, and Pelias, learing that he might attempt to recover
the kingdom, sent him to ietch the Golden Fleece from
Colchis, supposing this to be an impossible ieat. Jason witha
band ol heroes started in the ship Argo (called aiter Argus, its
³ builder), and alter many adventures reached Colchis. Here
Aeetes, king oi Colchis, who was unwilling to give up the
Fleece‚ set Jason to periorm what seemed an impossible task,
via, to plough a field with certain fire-breathing oxen and then
to sow it with dragon’s teeth. Medea, the daughter oi the
king, however, assisted Jason by her skill in magic, first to..
perform the task appointed, and then to procure the Fleece.
Medea then fied with Jason, and, in order to delay the pursuit
ol her lather, sacrificed her brother Absyrtus. After reaching
Thessaly, Medea caused the death of Pelias, and was, with her
husband, expelled from Thessaly. They removed to Corinth,
and here Medea, becoming jealous oi Glauce, daughter oi
Creon, caused her death by means oi apoisoned robe. After
this Medea was carried off in a chariot sent by the sun-god,
and Jason was soon afterwards accidentally killed.
