DE CLENSION.

DECLENSION.

4. Inuus are the Names of Things.
In English we say,—

The wasp killed the bee.
· The bee killed the wasp.

In these sentences the words “wasp” and “bec''
are unchanged; though in one the “wasp'' does
the action, and the “hee'' suffers the action. In
the other the opposite is true. The order only has
been altered.

In Latin this difference is expressed, not by alter-

ing the order, but by changes in the form of the
word called case-endingn

N onmnnve, vespa, apis, when the wasp or the bee
does the action.

Accosnnvn vespam, apem, when the wasp or the
bee suffers the action.

Vespa apem necavit. T lte wasp killed tlte bec. v
vespam apis nocivit„ T lte bec killed tlte wasp.

Pronouns are the only words in English which have
different forms for nominative and accusative.

ΝΟΜ. Ι; who.
Ace. me; whom.
