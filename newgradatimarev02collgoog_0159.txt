N'O'T'ES. 139

123. l. 8. doctus est: τῖε, Jason.

l. 9. subiistis ancoris: weighing ancher. Read the following
note on the Ablative Absolute:

(1) Α very common construction in Latin is that ot
a noun and a participle in the ablative‚ to ex·
press the time, cause, or some other circum-
stance of an action. The words in the ablative ,
are cut off grammatically irum the rest ot the
sentence, and hence this construction is called
the ablative absolute.

consul, pice facti, revertit: the consul,
peace having been made, returned.

(2) It is seldom best to render the ablative absolute
literally. Thus instead of the above, we may
render

1. T be consul, aster making peace, returned.

2. T lte consul, when peace lead been rnade,
returned.

3. T he consul, because peace had been made,
returned.

4. T ke consul made peace and returned.

(3) Sometimes instead of a noun and a participle in

the ablative we have
1. Two nouns.
2. :A pronoun and a participle.
3. A noun and an adjective. ,

l. 14. antequam . . . concurrerent: the imperfect and pluper·
fect tenses are usually in the subjunctive after ante-
quam and priusquam, but the subjunctive is generally
to be rendered as it it were indicative.

124. l. 4. contulerunt: from confero.

l. 7. negibat . . . esse: cl. 120, l. 12, and note.

l· 9· triditirrum: esse omitted, as often with forms made up
ot a participle and esse.

l. ιο. si . . . perfecisset: see 122, l. 9, and note.

l. 12. iungendi erant: were to be yoked.
