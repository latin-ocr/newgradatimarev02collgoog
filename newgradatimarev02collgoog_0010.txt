iv NOTE TO REVISED EDITION·

more than correct errors that had been overlooked in pre-

vious impressions, and make certain omissions; but pro
longed examination suggested other changes, together
with additions so various and important that it has
seemed necessary to modify the title in order to distin·
guish this edition from the book in its earlier form,

Thirty-four anecdotes have been omitted. Some of
these seemed rather pointless, others a little questionable
in tone or taste.

By permission of the author of Fabulae Faciles, Mr. F.
Ritchie‚ the Story of the Argonauts and the Story of Ulys-
ses, amounting to nearly thirty peges have been added.

Some important principles of grammar have been
added, emphasized, or expanded.

Notes explaining such difficulties as it has been found
embarrass and delay young pupils are given at the end
of the reading lessons

Finally, immediately following each anecdote‚ from two
to ten of the words that occur in the text are set down,
chosen out as likely to be the least familiar to the learner‚
and either defined by more familiar Latin words, or having
references to places where they have occurred in preced-
ing anecdotes Itis most important to encourage stu-
dents in every way to form the habit, when they meet
with what seems a new word, or a familiar word in a new
sense, of trying to recall its previous occurrence, instead
of turning at once to the vocabulary, or to a lexicon.
