he should look back, instead of referring again to the vocabuiary. If the former
meaning does not seem appropriate, the vocabuiary should be consulted and the
meanings in the two sentences be compared. lt will be apparent that only a few
of the words that are repeated have been selected for comparison.

Latin words are occasionally defined by other Latin words, supposed to be more

reading and wn'ting Latin, but the words defined and the definitione are no more
exact synonyms than in similar cases in English.
