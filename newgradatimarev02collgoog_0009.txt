'NOTE TO THE REVISED EDITION OF 1889.

ψ huius

Ι ΗΑνΕ found Gradatim to be a most useful book to
accompany and supplement the first year's work in Latin.
The Latin is pure, simple, and idiomatic, easily under-
stood by the young learners, interesting, and even amus·
ing. If Caesar must be read as the first classical author,
this book may be very happily used for some weeks to
smooth the way, by giving practice in translating easy
Latin. The enormous sale of the book in England shows
how helpful it has proved to teachers in Latin there.
The work of revision has consisted mainly in rewriting
the first twenty anecdote3‚ -in which the authors made
the unhappy experiment of writing the Latin in English
order‚,-marking the quantity of long vowels everywhere,
and correcting the vocabulary, which was unusually rich

in mistakes.
