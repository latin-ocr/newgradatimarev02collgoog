ACTIVE ANB PASSIVE. 41

A relative clause may be omitted without altering the
construction of any other word in the sentence.

(c) A relative word is often omitted in English
but never in Latin. Ι

ubl est ea mensa quam heri vidi? where is tlte table Isaw
yesterday?

(α’) The relative always comes first in its own
clause (except after prepositions), and generally
next to the word it qualilies.

Relative words are—

’ qut ouilia quantus
qu5. qui, unde. ubl

ACTIVE AND PASSIVE.

25. The Verb has two voices-

(ι) Aeliae, when you do something3
(a) Passiae, when something is done to you.

In turning a sentence from an active into a
passive form

accusative becomes nominative.
nominative becomes ablative.

All other cases remain unchanged.

inseres Manlium δ somno excitavenmt, geere wake
Manlius fram sleep. >
’ Manlius δ somn& insefibus excitatus eat. Manlius
was wakened from sleep by geere.
