NOTE TO RE VISED EDITION. v

The need oi putting some easy Latin into the hands ot
pupils very early in their study, to accompany and sup-
plement the learning of forms and the elements of syntax,
is now happily coming to be realized, and it is hoped
that The New Gradatim will be found to supply exaetly
that want. ·

The Stories of the Argonauts and of UlysseS, abound·
ing as they do in the words, idioms, and constructions

ot Caesar's Gallie War, ought to inake it easy for the

pupil to pass from them to The Gate to Caesam but it
will generally be better to interpose not a little easy and
rapid reading for the sake of an enlarged vocabulary.
